//! This module contains the UI components of the Talos library.
//!
//! The UI system is divided into two main parts:
//!
//! * **Layout:** The layout system is responsible for dividing the screen into different areas, and
//!   then placing widgets in them.
//! * **Rendering:** The rendering system is responsible for drawing the widgets to the screen.

/// Layouter
pub mod layout;

/// Renderer
pub mod render;
